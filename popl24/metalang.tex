Large practical MPC computations are based on much larger protocols
than the examples we've considered so far. These larger protocols are
typically based on compositional units. An example of this is Yao's
Garbled Circuits (YGC), which are composed of so-called garbled gates.
Languages for defined garbled circuits, beginning with Fairplay \cite{XXX},
treat gates as compositional units that are wired together by the programmer
to generate a complete circuit. The $\fedprot$ language is low-level
and does not include abstractions for defining composable elements. 

In this Section we introduce the $\metaprot$ language which includes
structured data and function definitions, which are sufficiently
expressive to define composable protocol elements such as garbled
gates. The $\metaprot$ language is a \emph{metalanguage}, in the sense
that it produces $\fedprot$ protocols as a result of computation. That
is, $\metaprot$ is a high-level language that generates low-level
protocol code.

\subsection{Syntax}

The syntax of $\metaprot$ is defined in Figure
\ref{fig-metaprot-syntax}.  It includes a syntax of function
definitions and records, and values include client ids, identifier
strings, and boolean expressions. Expression forms allow dynamic
construction of boolean expression forms and view assignments. When
$\metaprot$ programs construct a $\fedprot$ assignment, a side effect
occurs whereby the assignment is added to the end of the $\fedprot$
program accumulated during evaluation.

Formally, we consider a complete metaprogram to include both a
codebase and a ``main'' program that uses the codebase. 
\begin{definition}
A \emph{codebase} $\codebase$ is a list of function 
declarations. We write $ \codebase(f) = x_1,\ldots,x_n,\ e$
iff $f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \{ e \} \in \codebase$.
A \emph{metaprogram}, aka \emph{mataprotocol} is a pair of a 
codebase and expression $\codebase, e$. We may omit
$\codebase$ if it is clear from context.  
\end{definition}

When we consider the example of YGC in detail below, our focus will be
on developing a codebase that can be used to define arbitrary
circuits, i.e., complete and concrete protocols. Since strings and
identifiers can be constructed manually, and expressions can occur
inside assignments and boolean expression forms, function definitions
can generalize over $\fedprot$-level patterns to obtain composable
program units. As a simple example, consider 3 party secret
sharing as illustrated in Example \ref{example-he}. We can
define a function $\ttt{share3}$ that abstracts the process
of splitting a given client's secret into 3 separate shares.
\begin{example} \label{example-share3} The function $\ttt{share3}$ 
  splits a client's secret into 3 shares returned as a record
  with fields $\ttt{s1-3}$:
  \begin{verbatimtab}
    share3(client, secretid)
    {
      let s1 = flip[client, share1] in
      let s2 = flip[client, share2] in
      let s3 = (s1 xor s2) xor s[client, s: || secretid] in
      {s1 = s1;s2 = s2;s3 = s3}
    } \end{verbatimtab}
  Here is $\metaprot$ program that uses this this function definition:
  \begin{verbatimtab}
    let shares = share3(1, mysecret) in
    v[2,s1] := shares.s2;
    v[3,s1] := shares.s3 \end{verbatimtab}
  which generates the following $\minifed$ program, as we formalize in Example \ref{example-share3-eval}
  below:
  \begin{verbatimtab}
    v[2,s1] := flip[1, share2];
    v[3,s1] := flip[1, share1] xor flip[1, share2] xor s[1, s:mysecret] \end{verbatimtab}
\end{example}

\subsection{Semantics}

\begin{fpfig}[t]{Evaluation contexts and operational semantics of $\metaprot$.}{fig-metaprot-semantics}
$$
\begin{array}{rcl@{\hspace{3mm}}r}
E &::=& [\,] \mid \enot\ E \mid E\ \bop\ e \mid v\ \bop\ E \mid  \flip{E}{e} \mid \secret{E}{e} \mid \view{E}{e} \mid \oracle{E} \mid  \\[1mm]
& & \flip{\cid}{E} \mid \secret{\cid}{E} \mid \view{\cid}{E} \mid \send{E}{e} \mid \send{\view{\cid}{w}}{E} \mid \OT{E}{e}{e} \\[1mm]

& & \select{v}{v}{E} \mid \elet{x}{E}{e} \mid f(v,\ldots,v,E,e,\ldots,e) \mid \\[1mm]
& & \{ \flab = v;\ldots;\flab = v;\flab = E;\flab = e;\ldots;\flab = e \} \mid E.\flab \mid E\concat e \mid v \concat E
\end{array}
$$
\medskip
$$
\begin{array}{rcl@{\hspace{10mm}}r}
\config{\prog}{\elet{x}{v}{e}} &\redx& \config{\prog}{e[v/x]}\\
\config{\prog}{f(v_1,...,v_n)} &\redx&
\config{\prog}{e[v_1/x_1,\ldots,v_n/x_n]} & 
 \codebase(f) = x_1,\ldots,x_n,\ e\\
\config{\prog}{\{\ldots; \flab = v; \ldots\}.\flab} &\redx&
 \config{\prog}{v}\\
 \config{\prog}{w_1\concat w_2} &\redx& \config{\prog}{w_1w_2}\\
 \config{\prog}{v;e} &\redx& \config{\prog}{e}\\
\config{\prog}{\instr} &\redx& \config{\prog;\instr}{()}\\
\config{\prog}{E[e]} &\redx& \config{\prog'}{E[e']} & \text{if}\ \config{\prog}{e} \redx \config{\prog'}{e'} 
\end{array}
$$
\end{fpfig}

We define a small-step evaluation aka reduction relation $\redx$ in
Figure \ref{fig-metaprot-semantics}.  We write $\redxs$ to denote the
reflexive, transitive closure of $\redx$. Reduction is defined on
\emph{configurations} which are pairs of the form $\config{\prog}{e}$,
where $\prog$ is the $\minifed$ program accumulated during evaluation.
In this definition we write $e[v/x]$ to denote the substitution of $v$
for free occurences of $x$ in $e$. The rules are mostly standard,
except why a concrete $\minifed$ assignment is encountered it is added
to the end of $\prog$.

The rules rely on a definition of \emph{evaluation contexts} $E$
allowing computation within a larger program context, where $E[e]$
denotes an expression with $e$ in the hole $[]$ of $E$. Evaluation
contexts include boolean expression forms, allowing generalization
and instantiation of compositional program elements.
\begin{example}
  \label{example-share3-eval}
  Let $\codebase,e_{\ref{example-share3}}$ be the $\metaprot$ program and let 
  $\prog_{\ref{example-share3}}$ be the  $\minifed$ program defined
  in Example \ref{example-share3}. We refer to the latter as ``accumulated''
  by evaluation of the former in the sense that $\config{\varnothing}{e_{\ref{example-share3}}}
  \redxs \config{\prog_{\ref{example-share3}}}{\varnothing}$.
\end{example}

\subsection{A Library for Yao's Garbled Circuits}
\label{section-metalang-ygc}

\input{ygc}

In Figures \ref{fig-ygc-aux} and \ref{fig-ygc-gates} we define a
codebase for garbled circuits. This definition follows the
\emph{point-and-permute} method described in \cite{XXX} and elsewhere,
to which the reader is referred for more in-depth discussion.
In this implementation client 2 is the \emph{garbler} and
client 1 is the \emph{evaluator}. The garbler builds the garbled
tables and shares them with the evaluator, who then evaluates
the gate in an oblivious fashion until the final public output is
generated through decryption.

\emph{Wire labels} are fundamental to YGC, and essentially represent
gate output values in an encrypted form. In our definition, wire
labels are representated by records $\ttt{\{ k = }\beta_1\ttt{; p =
}\beta_2\ttt{ \}}$, where $\ttt{k}$ is the \emph{key bit} and
$\ttt{p}$ is the \emph{pointer bit}, and $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are
flips. Flips in each output wire label are owned by the garbler and
are unique per gate by definition of their identifying string, and the
representation of $0$ is the negation of $1$. For example, here is the
representation of 1 and 0 respectively in the output wire label for a
hypothetical gate 6:
\begin{mathpar}
  \ttt{\{ k = flip[2,gate:6.k]; p =  flip[2,gate:6.p]] \}}
    
  \ttt{\{ k = not flip[2,gate:6.k]; p =  not flip[2,gate:6.p]] \}}
\end{mathpar}
The pointer bits in wire labels are used to select permuted rows in
table garblings. The key bits are used to identify a unique key for
table row in each garbled gate. Intuitively, if $\beta_1$ and
$\beta_2$ are either key or pointer bits encoding 1 on two input wire
labels to a binary gate, rows and keys in the gate are enumerated in
the order:
$$
\neg\beta_1\neg\beta_2,\ \neg\beta_1\beta_2,\ \beta_1\neg\beta_2,\ \beta_1\beta_2
$$

In our implementation, gates are wired together using gate
identifiers, which are strings $w$. Top-level functionality in Figures
\ref{fig-ygc-aux} and \ref{fig-ygc-gates} includes the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item \ttt{andgate}: This defines a subprotocol for the garbler
  to define a garbled gate $\ttt{gid}$ with input wires from gates
  $\ttt{ga}$ and $\ttt{gb}$. The garbler generates keys and garbles
  the rows in YGC fashion, them with client $1$ in
  views in a standard form. For example, the view for
  a hypothetical gate 6, row 2 garbled truth table is $\ttt{v[1,gate:6tt2]}$.
  We note that garbled gates of other binary operators can be obtained with
  replacement of $\ttt{andtable}$ with appropriate garbled  table definitions. 
\item \ttt{evalgate}: This defines a subprotocol for the evaluator to
  evaluate gate $\ttt{gid}$ given input wire values $\ttt{wva}$ and
  $\ttt{wvb}$.
\item \ttt{garbledecode} and \ttt{evaldecode}: The former function
  defines the garbler's protocol for encrypting the circuit
  output from final gate $\ttt{gid}$, and the latter defines
  the evaluator's output decryption protocol.
\item \ttt{encode}: This defines the initial phase of the protocol,
  where the evaluator receives the wire value from their own
  secret $\sx{1}{sa}$ via $\ttt{OT}$, and the garbler communicates
  the wire value for their own secret $\sx{2}{sb}$ directly.
\end{itemize}
Here is an example program that uses this library to define
a ciruit with a single and gate and input secrets $\ttt{s1}$ and
$\ttt{s2}$ from client's 1 and 2 respectively. 
\begin{verbatimtab}
  andgate(0,s1,s2);
  garbledecode(0);
  let secrets = encode(s1,s2) in
  v[0,output] := decode(evalgate(0, secrets.wv1, secrets.wv2))
\end{verbatimtab}
We have verified passive security of the $\fedprot$ protocol
generated by this and other small circuits using the
technique described in Lemma \ref{lemma-bruteforce-nimo}.
But obviously large circuits with thousands of gates would be
intractable to verify with this method. In the next Section
we discuss compositional methods to address this issue.
