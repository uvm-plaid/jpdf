\title{Automating Verification of MPC Security: $\metaprot$ to $\minifed$}

\author{Author names withheld for double-blind reviewing}

\begin{abstract}
Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) protocols support data privacy in
important modern distributed applications. Security for MPC protocols
is superficially similar to probabilistic noninterference, but differs
in a subtle but fundamental way, and approaches for verifying
noninterference cannot naturally extend to MPC security.  Currently,
proof methods for MPC protocols are well-studied but manual
and thus tedious and error-prone, and are also non-standardized and
unfamiliar to most PL theorists.  Our goal is to strengthen
connections between the security model of MPC and trace-based
hyperproperties, and to leverage them to obtain automated
enforcement mechanisms for MPC protocol development.  We define a
novel hyperproperty that is provably sound for MPC security, as a
foundation for fully and partially automated verification of passive
MPC security in protocols including arbitrarily large YGC and GMW
circuits.
