This allows specification and inference of significantly more precise type information, facilitating program error detection and compiler optimization. A major complication resulting from introducing dependent types is that pure type inference for the enriched system is no longer possible, but we show that type-checking a sufficiently annotated program in DML(C) can be reduced to constraint satisfaction in the constraint domain C. We exhibit the unobtrusiveness of our approach through practical examples and prove that DML(C) is conservative over ML. The main contribution of the paper lies in our language design, including the formulation of type-checking rules which makes the approach practical. To our knowledge, no previous type system for a general purpose programming language such as ML has combined dependent types with features including datatype declarations, higher-order functions, general recursions, let-polymorphism, mutable references, and exceptions. In addition, we have finished a prototype implementation of DML(C) for an integer constraint domain C, where constraints are linear inequalities (Xi and Pfenning 1998).}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 26th ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages}, pages = {214-227}, numpages = {14}, location = {San Antonio, Texas, USA}, series = {POPL '99} }

In this tutorial, we provide a guide to how to write simulators and prove security via the simulation paradigm. Although we have tried to make this tutorial as stand-alone as possible, we assume some familiarity with the notions of secure encryption, zero-knowledge, and secure computation.",

abstract = {Secure Multi-party Computation (SMC) is seen as one of the main enablers for secure outsourcing of computation. Currently, there are many different SMC techniques (garbled circuits, secret sharing, homomorphic encryption, etc.) and none of them is clearly superior to others in terms of efficiency, security guarantees, ease of implementation, etc. For maximum efficiency, and for obeying the trust policies, a privacy-preserving application may wish to use several different SMC techniques for different operations it performs. A straightforward implementation of this application may result in a program that (i) contains a lot of duplicated code, differing only in the used SMC technique; (ii) is difficult to maintain, if policies or SMC implementations change; and (iii) is difficult to reuse in similar applications using different SMC techniques.In this paper, we propose a programming language called SecreC with associated compilation techniques for simple orchestration of multiple SMC techniques and multiple protection domains. It is a simple imperative language with function calls where the types of data items are annotated with protection domains and where the function declarations may be domain-polymorphic. This allows most of the program code working with private data to be written in a SMC-technique-agnostic manner. It also allows rapid deployment of new SMC techniques and implementations in existing applications. We have implemented the compiler for the language, integrated it with Sharemind SMC framework, and are currently using it for new privacy-preserving applications.},

abstract="Much work on security-typed languages lacks a satisfactory account of intentional information release. In the context of confidentiality, a typical security guarantee provided by security type systems is noninterference, which allows no information flow from secret inputs to public outputs. However, many intuitively secure programs do allow some release, or declassification, of secret information (e.g., password checking, information purchase, and spreadsheet computation). Noninterference fails to recognize such programs as secure. In this respect, many security type systems enforcing noninterference are impractical. On the other side of the spectrum are type systems designed to accommodate some information leakage. However, there is often little or no guarantee about what is actually being leaked. As a consequence, such type systems are vulnerable to laundering attacks, which exploit declassification mechanisms to reveal more secret data than intended. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a new security property, delimited release, an end-to-end guarantee that declassification cannot be exploited to construct laundering attacks. In addition, a security type system is given that straightforwardly and provably enforces delimited release.",

abstract = {Secure computation allows multiple parties to compute joint functions over private data without leaking any sensitive data, typically using powerful cryptographic techniques. Writing secure applications using these techniques directly can be challenging, resulting in the development of several programming languages and compilers that aim to make secure computation accessible. Unfortunately, many of these languages either lack or have limited support for rich recursive data structures, like trees. In this paper, we propose a novel representation of structured data types, which we call oblivious algebraic data types, and a language for writing secure computations using them. This language combines dependent types with constructs for oblivious computation, and provides a security-type system which ensures that adversaries can learn nothing more than the result of a computation. Using this language, authors can write a single function over private data, and then easily build an equivalent secure computation according to a desired public view of their data.},

abstract = {Secure multi-party computation (MPC) is a general cryptographic technique that allows distrusting parties to compute a function of their individual inputs, while only revealing the output of the function. It has found applications in areas such as auctioning, email filtering, and secure teleconference. Given their importance, it is crucial that the protocols are specified and implemented correctly. In the programming language community, it has become good practice to use computer proof assistants to verify correctness proofs. In the field of cryptography, EasyCrypt is the state of the art proof assistant. It provides an embedded language for probabilistic programming, together with a specialized logic, embedded into an ambient general purpose higher-order logic. It allows us to conveniently express cryptographic properties. EasyCrypt has been used successfully on many applications, including public-key encryption, signatures, garbled circuits and differential privacy. Here we show for the first time that it can also be used to prove security of MPC against a malicious adversary. We formalize additive and replicated secret sharing schemes and apply them to Maurer&#x27;s MPC protocol for secure addition and multiplication. Our method extends to general polynomial functions. We follow the insights from EasyCrypt that security proofs can often be reduced to proofs about program equivalence, a topic that is well understood in the verification of programming languages. In particular, we show that for a class of MPC protocols in the passive case the non-interference-based (NI) definition is equivalent to a standard simulation-based security definition. For the active case, we provide a new non-interference based alternative to the usual simulation-based cryptographic definition that is tailored specifically to our protocol.},
