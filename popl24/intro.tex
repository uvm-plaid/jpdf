\section{Introduction}

In this paper we make the following contributions.
\begin{itemize}
\item A new probabilistic programming language $\minifed$ for defining
  synchronous distributed protocols over the binary field. We consider example
  protocols including OT, communications encryption with one-time
  pads, and additive secret sharing (Section \ref{section-minicat}).
  \cnote{I'm hoping $\minifed$ hasn't been used already.}
\item A formulation of $\minifed$ program distributions, including
  distributions of secrets and views, supporting expression of security
  properties (Section \ref{section-pmf}). This intensional characterization
  is useful for expressing internal characteristics of protocols, and
  is needed for MPC due to the fact that obliviousness alone is not sufficient
  to capture characteristics of the real/ideal model, in particular the
  allowance of some information leakage through public outputs. 
\item A novel hyperproperty of program execution traces, called
  \emph{nonintererence modulo output ($\NIMO$)}, based on our
  formulation of program distributions, that implies passive security
  (Section \ref{section-hyperprop}).
\item A brute force mechanism for verifying passive security in
  $\minifed$ protocols, that is also amenable to HPC optimizations via
  translation of $\minifed$ protocols into Datalog (Section \ref{section-bruteforce}). 
\item A new metaprogramming language $\metaprot$ that dynamically
  generates $\minifed$ protocols. It includes control and data structures
  and is able to express logical protocol components, and enjoys a
  type safety result that guarantees that generated protocols
  are semantically well-defined (Section \ref{section-metalang}).
\item A formulation of Yao's Garbled Circuits, and a formulation of a
  compositional property of an extensible library of garbled gate
  components that is verifiable automatically. This property
  guarantees that any well-formed circuits using the library are
  passive secure (Section \ref{section-composition}).
\end{itemize}
