\subsection{Probability Mass Functions and Program Distributions}
\label{section-pmf}

Given a program $\prog$ with $\iov(\prog) = S \cup V$ and $\store \in
\mems(\iov(\prog))$, we are fundamentally concerned with the joint
probability of the assignments in $\store_V$ conditioned by the
assignments $\store_S$ in any given run, since probabilistic
dependence between honest secrets and corrupt views is our metric of
information leakage.

\subsection{Basic Definitions} 

We begin by defining joint probability mass functions in the standard
manner, though following \cite{barthe2019probabilistic} we use
memories to denote mappings of variables to values (i.e., outcomes),
so for example given a pmf $\pmf$ we will write $\pmf(\{ \sx{1}{a}
\mapsto 0, \vx{2}{b} \mapsto 1 \})$ to denote the probability that
$\sx{1}{a} = 0$ and $\vx{2}{b} = 1$ in the final memory of a
program containing these variables.
\begin{definition}
  A \emph{probability mass function} $\pmf$ is a function
  mapping memories in $\mems(X)$ for some $X$ to values in $[0,1]$, such that:
  $$
  \sum_{\store \in \mems(X)} \pmf(\store) \  = \ 1
  $$
\end{definition}
%To recover succinct and familiar notation, we may omit the domain of a
%distribution when it is clear from an application context-
%i.e., we allow the following sugaring:
%$$
%\pdf{}(\store) \defeq \pdf{\dom(\store)}(\store)
%$$
Now, we can define a notion of marginal and conditional
distributions as follows, which are standard for discrete
probability mass functions. 
\begin{definition}
  Given $\pmf$ the \emph{marginal distribution} of variables $X$
  in $\pmf$, denoted $\margd{\pmf}{X}$, is defined as follows:
  $$
  \forall \store \in \mems(X) \quad . \quad \margd{\pmf}{X}(\store) =
  \sum_{\store' \in \mems(X-\dom(\dom(\pmf)))} \pmf(\store \cap \store')
  $$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  Given $\margd{\pmf}{X}$, its \emph{conditional distribution given
  $\stores$} with $\dom(\stores) = Y$ with $Y \subseteq X$, denoted
  $\condd{\pmf}{X}{\stores}$, is a distribution with domain $X$ where for all
  $\store \in \mems(X)$:
  $$
  \condd{\pmf}{X}{\stores}(\store) =
  (\sum_{\store' \in \stores} \margd{\pmf}{X}(\store \cap \store')) /
  (\sum_{\store' \in \stores} \margd{\pmf}{Y}(\store'))
  $$
  where $\margd{\pmf}{X}(\store \cap \store')) = 0$ if $\store \cap \store'$ is undefined.
\end{definition}
To recover familiar notation we allow the syntactic
sugarings $\condd{\pmf}{X}{\store}  \defeq \condd{\pmf}{X}{\{ \store\}}$, and
$\pmf(\store)  \defeq \margd{\pmf}{X}(\store)$ and $\pmf(\store|\stores) \defeq
\condd{\pmf}{X}{\stores}(\store)$ where $\dom(\store) = X$.
%\begin{eqnarray*}
%  \condd{\pmf}{X}{\store}  &\defeq& \condd{\pmf}{X}{\{ \store\}}\\
%  \pmf(\store)  &\defeq& \margd{\pmf}{X}(\store)  \qquad \dom(\store) = X\\
%  \pmf(\store|\stores)  &\defeq& \condd{\pmf}{X}{\stores}(\store) \qquad \dom(\store) = X
%\end{eqnarray*}

\subsection{Program Distributions}
Now we can define the probability distribution of a program $\prog$,
that we denote $\progd(\prog)$. Since $\fedcat$ is deterministic the
results (view assignments) of any run are determined by the input
secrets together with the random tape. And since we constrain programs
to not overwrite views, we are assured that \emph{final} memories
contain both a complete record of all initial secrets as well as views
resulting from communicated information.

We consider random tapes to be selected from a uniform distribution.
In our threat model, we will also assume that any possible initial
secrets are equally likely when formulating the program distribution.
In this setting, given a program $\prog$ with $\iov(\prog) = S \cup
V$ and $\flips(\prog) = F$ we will consider all $\store
\in \mems(S \cup V \cup F)$ such that
$
\config{\store_{S \cup F}}{\prog} \redxs \config{\store_}{\varnothing}
$
to be equally probable, establishing the basic distribution of the
program. From this, we can immediately derive the marginal distribution
of $S \cup V$ to reason about dependencies between secrets and views. 
\begin{definition}
  \label{def-progd}
  \label{definition-progd}
  Given program $\prog$ with $\iov(\prog) = (S,V)$ and $\flips(\prog) = F$, define $\stores$ as:
  $$
  \stores \defeq \{ \store \mid (\dom(\store) = S \cup V \cup F) \wedge (\store_{S \cup F},\prog) \redxs (\store,\varnothing) \}
  $$
  We note immediately that $|\stores| = 2^{S \cup F}$ given the (deterministic) definition of $\redx$. 
  Define also $\pmf$ as the program's \emph{basic distribution} such that for all
  $\store \in \mems(S \cup V \cup F)$:
  $$
  \pmf(\store) =  1 / |\stores| \ \text{if}\ \store \in \stores, \text{otherwise}\ 0
  %\begin{cases}
  %  1 / |\stores| & \text{if}\ \store \in \stores\\
  %  0 & \text{otherwise}
  %\end{cases}
  $$
  Then the \emph{program distribution of $\prog$}, denoted $\progd(\prog)$, is the
  marginal distribution of $S \cup V$ in $\prog$'s basic distribution, i.e., 
  $
  \progd(\prog) \defeq  \margd{\pmf}{S\cup V}
  $.
  In some cases, we will also be concerned with the (joint)
  probabilities of expression interpretation given a preceding program
  execution, and we write $\progd(\prog, \be)$ to denote the program
  distribution $\progd(\prog;\itv := \be)$ where $\itv$ is a
  special variable that is never used in programs.
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}
  We write $\vc{\pmf}{x}{y}$ iff $\pmf(\{ x \mapsto 0\}\ |\ \{ y \mapsto 0 \}) =
  \pmf(\{ x \mapsto 1\}\ |\ \{ y \mapsto 1 \}) = 1$.
  We write $\sep{\pmf}{X}{Y}$ iff for all
    $\store \in \mems(X \cup Y)$ we have
  $\margd{\pmf}{X \cup Y}(\store) =
  \pmf(\store_X) * \pmf(\store_Y)$
\end{definition}

\subsection{Passive Security}

The simulator is represented by a probabilistic algorithm $\SIM_C$,
aka a \emph{simulation}, that is parameterized by corrupt inputs and
the output of an ideal functionality, and that returns a set of
adversarial views (as a memory) with some probability. Given
corrupt inputs $\store$ and ideal functionality output $v$,  
we write
$
\prob(\SIM(\store,v) = \store')
$
to denote the probability that $\SIM(\store,v)$
returns corrupt views $\store'$ as a result. We can then define the
probability distribution of corrupt views reconstructed
by the simulator as follows:
\begin{definition}
  Given $C$, $\store$, and $v$, we write $\dist(\SIM(\store,v))$ to
  denote the distribution of corrupt views reconstructed by the
  simulation, where for
  all $\store' \in \mems(V)$:
  $$
  \dist(\SIM(\store,v))(\store')\ \defeq\ \prob(\SIM(\store,v) = \store') 
  $$
\end{definition}

Then we can define passive security in the real/ideal
model as follows. 
\begin{definition}[Passive Security]
  Assume given a program $\prog$ that correctly implements an ideal
  functionality $\idealf$, with $\iov(\prog) = (S,M,O)$.  Then $\prog$
  is \emph{passive secure in the simulator model} iff for all
  partitions of the federation into honest and corrupt sets $H$ and $C$
  with $|C| < |H|$ and for all $\store \in \mems(S)$ there exists a
  simulation $\SIM$ such that:
  $$
  \dist(\SIM(\store_{S_C},\idealf(\store))) = \condd{\progtt(\prog)}{M_C}{\store}
  $$
\end{definition}

\subsection{Malicious Security}

$$
\begin{array}{rclr}
  (\store, \eassign{\mesg{w}}{\cid_1}{\be}{\cid_2};\prog) &\aredx&
  (\extend{\store}{\mesg{w}_{\cid_1}}{\lcod{\store,\be}{\cid_2}}, \prog) & \cid_2 \in H\\
  (\store, \eassign{\mesg{w}}{\cid_1}{\be}{\cid_2};\prog) &\aredx&
  (\extend{\store}{\mesg{w}_{\cid_1}}{\lcod{\arewrite(\store_C,\be)}{\cid_2}}, \prog) & \cid_2 \in C
\end{array}
$$

\begin{definition}[Corrupt Inputs, Honest Outputs]
  Given a program $\prog$ with $\iov(\prog) = (S,M,O)$ , define $\cinputs$ as the
  messages in $M$ sent from corrupt to honest parties:
  $$
  \cinputs = \{\ \elab{\mesg{w}}{\cid}\ \mid\  \elab{\mesg{w}}{\cid} \in M \wedge \eassign{\mesg{w}}{\cid}{\be}{\cid'} \in \prog
  \wedge \cid \in H \wedge \cid' \in C \ \} 
  $$
  and similarly define $\houtputs$ as the messages in $M$ sent from honest to corrupt parties.
  %Define also $(\afilter\ \prog)$ as $\prog$ with all instructions of the form $\eassign{\mesg{w}}{\cid}{\be}{\cid'}$ removed
  %where $\cid \in H \wedge \cid' \in C$.
\end{definition}

$$
\dist(\SIM(\store_{S_H})) = \condd{\progtt(\prog)}{\houtputs \cup O_H}{\store_{S_H}}
$$
