  \begin{abstract}
  Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) is an important
  enabling technology for data privacy in modern distributed
  applications. We devevelop a new type theory to automatically
  enforce correctness, confidentiality, and integrity properties
  of protocols written in the \emph{Prelude/Overture} language
  framework. Judgements in the type theory are predicated on
  SMT verifications in a theory of finite fields.
