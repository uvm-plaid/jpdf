\section{Confidentiality Types}
\label{section-cpj}

It is well-known that adding or subtracting a sample from a uniform
distribution in a finite field yields a value in a uniform
distribution, meaning that samples can be used as one-time-pads with
perfect secrecy \cite{barthe2019probabilistic,darais2019language}.
In our type system for confidentiality, we aim to approximate
distributions by tracking which program variables an expression
may depend on. But we also want to capture this fundamental mechanism
of encryption. As we will show, SMT can be used in this and
other contexts to support confidentiality properties of protocols.

For example, given some string $y$ and a message send such as:
$$
\xassign{\mx{w}{1}}{\secret{w} \ftimes \flip{w}}{2}
$$
we would assign the following type to denote that $\mx{w}{1}$ is dependent on
both $\sx{w}{2}$ and $\rx{w}{2}$:
$$
\mx{w}{1} : \setit{\sx{w}{2}, \rx{w}{2}}
$$
But in the case of 2-party reconstructive sharing:
$$
\xassign{\mx{w}{1}}{\secret{w} \fminus \flip{w}}{2}
$$
we want the type of $\mx{w}{1}$ to be an ``encrypted'' type that is
by itself independent of $\sx{w}{2}$. However, we also want to track
the \emph{joint} dependence of $\mx{w}{2}$ on $\rx{w}{2}$ and
$\sx{w}{2}$, in case information about $\rx{w}{2}$ is subsequently
leaked.  In short, we assign $\mx{w}{1}$ a ``ciphertext type'', aka a
\emph{ciphertype}:
$$
\mx{w}{1} : \cty{\rx{w}{2}}{\setit{\sx{w}{2}}}
$$
indicating syntactically that $\mx{w}{1}$ is an encryption of a
value dependent on $\sx{w}{2}$ with $\rx{w}{2}$.

Of course, there are other methods for encrypting values in MPC
protocols-- but we can observe that many are algebraically equivalent
to this fundamental schema. For example, in Yao's Garbled Circuits
(YGC) in $\mathbb{F}_{2}$, the ``garbler'' represents encrypted wire
values as a random sample (for 1) or its negation (for 0), and shares
its secret input encoding with the ``evaluator'' by using
it as a selection bit. That is, assuming that client 2 is the garbler and
client 1 is the evaluator, we can define:
$$
\xassign{\mx{w}{1}}{\mux{\secret{w}}{\neg\flip{w}}{\flip{w}}}{2}
$$
where for all $\be_1,\be_2,\be_3$ (with $\neg$ denoting negation in $\mathbb{F}_2$):
$$
\mux{\be_1}{\be_2}{\be_3} \defeq (\neg\be_1 \ftimes \be_2) \fplus (\be_1 \ftimes \be_3)
$$
and letting this protocol be $\prog$ the following is valid:
\begin{mathpar}
%\toeq{\xassign{\mx{w}{1}}{\OT{\secret{w}}{1}{\neg\flip{w}}{\flip{w}}}{2}}
   \toeq{\prog} \models \mx{w}{1} \eop \neg\sx{w}{2} \fplus \rx{w}{2}
\end{mathpar}
This allows us to assign the same ciphertype to $\mx{w}{1}$ as above--
that is, $\cty{\rx{w}{2}}{\setit{\sx{w}{2}}}$.  Since this is a
one-time-pad scheme, it is also important that we ensure that samples
are used at most once for encryption. As in previous work 
\cite{darais2019language} we use type linearity to enforce this.

\cpjfig

The syntax of types $\ty$ and type environments $\Gamma$ are presented
in Figure \ref{fig-cpj}\footnote{In general we use $2^{\chi}$ to
denote the powerset of terms in any grammatical sort $\chi$.}. We also
define type judgements for expressions and programs by direct
interpretation as terms $\phi$ and constraints $\eqs$ respectively,
via the encoding $\toeq{\cdot}$. The \TirName{Encode} rule enforces
linearity by requiring that variables used for encryption are added to
judgements, and guaranteed to not be used elsewhere via a form of
union that ensures disjointness of combined sets:
\begin{definition}
  $R_1;R_2 = R_1 \cup R_2$ if $R_1 \cap R_2 = \varnothing$ and is otherwise
  undefined.
\end{definition}
The \TirName{DepTy} rule handles all cases and just records the
dependencies on variables in the term, a conservative approximation of
dependencies.  The \TirName{Send} rule records the types of messages,
reveals, and outputs in enviroments, and the \TirName{Seq} rule
combines the types of sequenced programs.  Given this we define
validity of program type judgements as follows.
\begin{definition}
  Given preprocessing predicate $\eqspre$ and protocol $\prog$ we say
  $\cpj{R}{\eqs}{\eqspre \wedge \toeq{\prog}}{\Gamma}$ is \emph{valid} iff it is derivable and
  $\eqspre \wedge \toeq{\prog} \models \eqs$.
\end{definition}
It is important to note that this presentation of derivations is
logical, not algorithmic-- in particular it is not syntax-directed
due to the \TirName{Encode} rule.

\subsection{Detecting Leakage Through Dependencies}

Given a valid typing, we can leverage structural type information to
conservatively approximate the information accessible by the
adversary who has control over all corrupt clients in $C$ given
a partitioning $H,C$. In particular, if the adversary has access to an
encypted value and another value that is dependent on its one-time-pad
key-- i.e., access to values with types of the forms:
$$
\setit{\cty{\rx{w}{\cid}}{\ty}} \qquad \setit{\rx{w}{\cid}, \ldots} 
$$
then we can conservatively assume that the adversary can decrypt the
value of type $\ty$ and thus have access to those values.

In Figure \ref{fig-leakj} we define derivation rules for the
``leakage'' judgement $\leakj{\Gamma}{C}{\ty}$ which intuitively says
that given a protocol with type environment $\Gamma$ and corrupt
clients $C$, the adversary may be able to observe dependencies on
values of type $\ty$ in their adversarial messages.  The real aim of
this relation is to determine if
$\leakj{\Gamma}{C}{\setit{\sx{w}{\cid}}}$ with $\cid \in H$-- that is,
if the adversary may observe dependencies on honest secrets.

Our main type soundness result combines typing and leakage judgements,
and guarantees gradual release of protocols-- that is, that adversarial
messages reflect no dependencies on honest secrets. Proof details are
provided in an Appendix.
\begin{theorem}
  \label{theorem-cpj}
  Given $\prog$ with $\views(\prog) = M \cup P$, if $\cpj{R}{\eqs}{\eqspre \wedge \toeq{\prog}}{\Gamma}$
  is valid and for all $H,C$ we have $\leakj{\Gamma}{M_C}{T}$ with $T$ closed
  and $S_H \cap T = \varnothing$, then $\prog$ satisfies gradual release.
\end{theorem}

\leakjfig

It is important to recall from \cite{skalka-near-ppdp24} that gradual
release does \emph{not} imply passive security, since it only concerns
adversarial messages, but not public reveals of outputs where
dependencies on input secrects can occur even in secure
protocols. Nevertheless, gradual release is an important
confidentiality property for MPC (and other distributed) protocols.
