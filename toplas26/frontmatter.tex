\begin{abstract}
  Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) is an important enabling
  technology for data privacy in modern distributed applications. We
  develop a new Hoare logic and type theory to automatically enforce
  correctness, confidentiality, and integrity properties of protocols
  written in the \emph{Prelude/Overture} language framework. Both
  definition and automation of our analyses leverages SMT
  verification, supporting precision and efficiency. Our approach is
  compositional, scalable, and generalizes to arbitrary prime fields
  and secret sharing schemes.
