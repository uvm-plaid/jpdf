\section{$\minicat$ SMT-Based Hoare Logic}
\label{section-smt}

In previous work it was shown that the semantics of $\minicat$ in
$\mathbb{F}_2$ can be implemented with Datalog
\cite{skalka-near-ppdp24}, which is a form of constraint
programming. In this paper we extend this idea to arbitrary prime
fields by using a more general form of SMT constraint programming,
Satisfiability Modulo Finite Fields \cite{SMFF}. As we will show in
subsequent sections, this interpretation supports automated
enforcement of correctness guarantees, and also static type analyses
for enforcing confidentiality and integrity properties.
In this section we formulate a Hoare Logic for $\minicat$
as a foundation for protocol verification.

\subsection{Constraint Satisfiability Modulo Finite Fields}

We introduce the following syntax of SMT-style constraints for
$\minicat$:
$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
  \phi ::= x \mid \phi \fplus \phi \mid \phi \fminus \phi \mid \phi \ftimes \phi  \qquad
  \eqs ::= \phi \eop \phi \mid \eqs \wedge \eqs \mid \eqs \vee \eqs \mid \neg\eqs \mid \eqs \impl \eqs
\end{array}
$$
%
%In Figure \ref{fig-eqs} we define a syntax of SMT-style constraints
%$\eqs$, where
Note that constraint terms $\phi$ are similar to expressions $\be$
except that $\phi$ can ``cross party lines''. This is needed
to express correctness properties-- for example, in the
Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson (GMW) protocol wire values in circuits are
represented by reconstructive shares \cite{evans2018pragmatic}.  If by
convention shares of values $n$ are represented by $\mesg{n}$ on
clients, then assuming two clients $\setit{1,2}$ the reconstructed
value can be expressed as $\mx{n}{1} + \mx{n}{2}$.  So, while summing
values across clients is disallowed in $\minicat$ protocols, we can
express properties of shared values via constraints.

%\begin{fpfig}[t]{Syntax of constraints}{fig-eqs}
%$$
%\begin{array}{rcl}
%  \phi ::= x \mid \phi \fplus \phi \mid \phi \fminus \phi \mid \phi \ftimes \phi  \qquad
%  \eqs ::= \phi \eop \phi \mid \eqs \wedge \eqs \mid \neg\eqs
%\end{array}
%$$
%
%\begin{mathpar}
%  \store(\phi_1 \fplus \phi_2) = \cod{\store(\phi_1) \fplus \store(\phi_2)}
%  
%  \store(\phi_1 \ftimes \phi_2) = \cod{\store(\phi_1) \ftimes \store(\phi_2)}
%  
%  \store(\phi_1 \fminus \phi_2) = \cod{\store(\phi_1) \fminus \store(\phi_2)}
%\end{mathpar}
%\end{fpfig}

This language of constraints has an obvious direct interpretation in
Satisfiability Modulo Finite Fields \cite{SMFF}. We can leverage this
to implement a critical \emph{entailment} property, written $\eqs_1
\models \eqs_2$.  Our entailment relation is based on satisfiability
in a standard sense, where we represent models as memories $\store$
(mappings from variables to values).
\begin{definition}
  We write $\store \models \eqs$ iff $\store$ satisfies, aka is a model
  of, $\eqs$. We write $\eqs_1 \models
  \eqs_2$ iff  $\store \models E_1$ implies $\store \models
  E_2$ for all $\store$, and note that this relation is a preorder.
\end{definition}
Given this Definition, the following Theorem is well-known and a fundamental
technique in SMT to implement our (common) notion of entailment. 
\begin{theorem}
  $\eqs_1 \models \eqs_2$ iff $\eqs_1 \wedge \neg\eqs_2$ is
  not satisfiable.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Programs as Constraint Systems}
\label{section-smt-toeq}

\begin{fpfig}[t]{Interpretation of $\minicat$ expressions (T) and programs (B) as
  constraints}{fig-toeq}
\begin{mathpar}
  \toeq{x} = x

  \toeq{\elab{\be_1 \fplus \be_2}{\cid}} = (\toeq{\elab{\be_1}{\cid}} \fplus \toeq{\elab{\be_2}{\cid}})

  \toeq{\elab{\be_1 \fminus \be_2}{\cid}} = (\toeq{\elab{\be_1}{\cid}} \fminus \toeq{\elab{\be_2}{\cid}})

  \toeq{\elab{\be_1 \ftimes \be_2}{\cid}} = (\toeq{\elab{\be_1}{\cid}} \ftimes \toeq{\elab{\be_2}{\cid}})
\end{mathpar}
\begin{mathpar}
  \toeq{\xassign{x}{\be}{\cid}} = (x \eop \toeq{\elab{\be}{\cid}})
  
  \toeq{\elab{\assert{\be_1 = \be_2}}{\cid}} =  (\toeq{\elab{\be_1}{\cid}} \eop \toeq{\elab{\be_2}{\cid}})

  \toeq{\prog_1;\prog_2} = (\toeq{\prog_1} \wedge \toeq{\prog_2})
\end{mathpar}
\end{fpfig}

A central idea of our approach is that we can interpret any protocol
$\prog$ as a set of equality constraints (denoted $\toeq{\prog}$) and use an SMT
solver to verify properties relevant to correctness, confidentiality,
and integrity. Further, we can leverage entailment for tractability--
we can use annotations to obtain a weakened precondition for relevant properties.
That is, given $\prog$, program annotations or other cues can be used
to find a minimal $\eqs$ with $\toeq{\prog} \models \eqs$ for verifying
correctness and security.

The mapping $\toeq{\cdot}$ from programs $\prog$ to constraints is
defined in Figure \ref{fig-toeq}. The interpretation of OT is omitted
from this figure which is general. For $\mathbb{F}_2$ (where we allow
negation $\neg$ of expressions) the interpretation is:
\begin{mathpar}
  \toeq{\elab{\OT{\be_1}{\cid_1}{\be_2}{\be_3}}{\cid_2}} =
  (\toeq{\elab{\be_1}{\cid_1}} \ftimes \toeq{\elab{\be_3}{\cid_2}}) \fplus
  (\neg\toeq{\elab{\be_1}{\cid_1}} \ftimes \toeq{\elab{\be_2}{\cid_2}}) 
\end{mathpar}
In general we will assume that any preprocessing predicate is defined
via a constraint $\eqspre$, i.e., $\preproc(\store) \iff \store
\models \eqspre$ for all $\store$. Intuitively, a protocol satisfies
a correctness (post)condition $\eqs$ if its SMT interpretation
entails $\eqs$.

%The correctness of the
%SMT interpretation of programs is characterized as follows.
%\begin{theorem}
%  \label{theorem-toeq}
%  $\store$ is a model of $\eqspre \wedge \toeq{\prog}$ iff $\store \in \runs(\prog)$.
%\end{theorem}

\subsubsection{Example: Correctness of 3-Party Addition}
Consider the following 3-party additive secret sharing protocol, where
each party generates two additive secret shares
\cite{evans2018pragmatic} for their respective secrets. Each party
publicly reveals the sums all their shares, and the sum of those is
the protocol output for each party.  
$$
\begin{array}{c@{\qquad}c}
\begin{array}{lll}
  \elab{\mesg{s1}}{2} &:=& \elab{(\secret{1} \fminus \locflip \fminus \flip{x})}{1} \\ 
  \elab{\mesg{s1}}{3} &:=& \elab{\flip{x}}{1} \\ 
  \elab{\mesg{s2}}{1} &:=& \elab{(\secret{2} \fminus \locflip \fminus \flip{x})}{2} \\ 
  \elab{\mesg{s2}}{3} &:=& \elab{\flip{x}}{2} \\ 
  \elab{\mesg{s3}}{1} &:=& \elab{(\secret{3} \fminus \locflip \fminus \flip{x})}{3} \\ 
  \elab{\mesg{s3}}{2} &:=& \elab{\flip{x}}{3}
\end{array} & 
\begin{array}{lll}
  \rvl{1} &:=& \elab{(\locflip \fplus \mesg{s2} \fplus \mesg{s3})}{1} \\ 
  \rvl{2} &:=& \elab{(\mesg{s1} \fplus \locflip \fplus \mesg{s3})}{2} \\
  \rvl{3} &:=& \elab{(\mesg{s1} \fplus \mesg{s2} \fplus \locflip)}{3} \\
  \out{1} &:=& \elab{(\rvl{1} \fplus \rvl{2} + \rvl{3})}{1}\\
  \out{2} &:=& \elab{(\rvl{1} \fplus \rvl{2} + \rvl{3})}{2}\\
  \out{3} &:=& \elab{(\rvl{1} \fplus \rvl{2} + \rvl{3})}{3}
\end{array}
\end{array}
$$
Letting $\prog$ be this protocol, we can verify correctness
as follows-- that is, the output sum of all shares is the sum of the
three input secrets:
$$
\toeq{\prog}\ \models\ \out{1} \eop \sx{1}{1} \fplus \sx{2}{2} \fplus \sx{3}{3}
$$

\noindent We can establish a logical identity between the models of a program and
its (non-adversarial) runs as follows.   
\begin{theorem}
  \label{theorem-toeq}
  $\sigma \models \eqspre \wedge \toeq{\prog}$ iff $\store \in \runs(\prog)$.
\end{theorem}
\noindent This result follows as a consequence of a more general Lemma
that incorporates a notion of preconditions. 
\begin{lemma}
  \label{lemma-toeq}
  Given $\eqs, \prog, \store$ with $\store \models \eqs$.
  Then $(\store,\prog) \redxs \store'$ iff $\store' \models
  \eqs \wedge \toeq{\prog}$.
\end{lemma}
\cnote{Prove me?}

\subsection{$\minicat$ Hoare Logic}

When reasoning about MPC protocols it is important to reason about
postconditions, e.g., to verify correctness conditions. It is also
important to reason about preconditions of protocols, e.g., to express
properties of assumed initialization protocols such as Beaver Triples.
To support this reasoning we introduce a Hoare logic for $\minicat$,
where $\htrip{\eqs_1}{\prog}{\eqs_2}$ means that $\eqs_1,\eqs_2$ are
the preconditions and postconditions, respectively, of $\prog$.
A semantic notion of validity for Hoare triples is defined as
follows:

\minicathtripfig

\begin{definition}
$\htrip{\eqs_1}{\prog}{\eqs_2}$ is \emph{valid} iff $\eqs_1 \wedge \toeq{\prog} \models \eqs_2$.
\end{definition}

The following Lemma establishes that this is a meaningful (and
standard) definition. It follows by Lemma \ref{lemma-toeq}
and transitivity of $\models$.
\begin{lemma}
  \label{lemma-hoare}
  Given $\eqs_1, \eqs_2, \prog, \store$ with $\store \models \eqs_1$
  and $\eqs_1 \wedge \toeq{\prog} \models \eqs_2$. Then
  $(\store,\prog) \redxs \store'$ implies $\store' \models
  \eqs_2$.
\end{lemma}

Now we can introduce a validity-preserving derivation system for the
$\minicat$ Hoare logic. Since the language is computationally simple
the Hoare logic can be relatively simple and mostly standard.
The derivation rules are specified in Figure \ref{fig-minicathtrip}.
They are mostly familiar except perhaps for \TirName{Assert}, which
just enforces the expected equality as a precondition, and
\TirName{Hyp}. It is unknown to the authors and not immediately
obvious whether \TirName{Hyp} is derivable from other rules, but
it is validity preserving as we show below. Its main use in this
paper will be to enable an automated Hoare logic check we develop
later (Section \ref{section-metahtrip}).
\begin{lemma}
  If $\htrip{\eqs_1}{\prog}{\eqs_2}$ is derivable, then it is valid.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Assume $\htrip{\eqs_1}{\prog}{\eqs_2}$ is derivable without \TirName{Hyp}.
  Then $\eqs_1 \wedge \toeq{\prog} \models \eqs_2$, since all the other rules
  are well-known to be validity preserving. 
  Now since $\eqs_1 \wedge \toeq{\prog} \models \eqs_2$ by assumption, we have
  $
  \eqs_1 \wedge (\eqs_2 \impl \eqs) \wedge \toeq{\prog} \models \eqs_2 
  $,
  and clearly:
  $$
  \eqs_1 \wedge (\eqs_2 \impl \eqs) \wedge \toeq{\prog} \models \eqs_2 \wedge (\eqs_2 \impl \eqs)
  $$
  and since $\eqs_2 \wedge (\eqs_2 \impl \eqs)$ iff
  $\eqs_2 \wedge \eqs$, we have
  $\eqs_1 \wedge (\eqs_2 \impl \eqs) \wedge \toeq{\prog} \models \eqs_2 \wedge \eqs$.
\end{proof}
